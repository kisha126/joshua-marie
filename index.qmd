::: {.hero-subtitle}
I am a (self-proclaimed) computer scientist, technical person, and a statistician. I studied layers of programming paradigms. From what I studied so far, R and Python have closely equivalent feature parities. I write packages for statistics, data science, and numerical analysis, as my specialties found in those fields.
